## About the project

This was my first full stack project. Almost everything was new to me here, I relied a lot on documentation especially when it came to Mongoose on the backend.

I enjoyed creating the mobile view, using three buttons to navigate the lists.

This project definitely would benefit from many improvements such as changing to TypeScript and implementing tests, adding authentication and user accounts and possibly even the ability to customise the lists or even add more.
